Twitter-Bot Template

***This template is currently in alpha phase***

This template allows for the quick setup of Twitter Bots.
It is a general purpose template that combines several different types of Twitter Bots into one script.

The script is designed to trigger the bots at a specified time using a cron-like system developed by Gustave Michel.

Twitter authentication is defined under config.cfg. 

Bots are defined under polls.cfg

Four types of bots are supported currently:
	-Countdown
	-Functional
	-Substitute
	-Standard
	
Each bot is defined and an example is given in greater detail below.

####Countdown####
This bot is designed to take in a date and determine the number of days until that date appears. The bot requires a string to already exist. An example is shown below:

	[Countdown Example]
	time: 0 0 * * * 
	user: ExampleUser
	function: Countdown
	date: 12/31/1969 # dates should be entered in the MM/DD/YYYY format
	message: The epoch begins %s!
	substitute_message: None
	
This configuration will cause the bot to run at midnight everyday. 
Should the date be 12/15/1969 the bot will tweet: "The epoch begins in 16 days!"
Should the date be 12/30/1969 the bot will tweet: "The epoch begins tomorrow!"
Should the date be 12/31/1969 the bot will tweet: "The epoch begins today!"
Should the date be after the specified date the bot will not tweet.

####Function####
This bot is designed to take in a python function and substitute the result of the function into the tweet. The bot requires a string to already exist. An example is shown below:

	[Functional Example]
	time: 0 0 * * *
	user: ExampleUser
	function: Functional
	date: None # notice date will not be used by this bot
	message: Today is %s.
	substitute_message: datetime.date.today() # this must be defined for this bot-type

####Substitute####
This bot is designed to substitute a hardcoded string into a tweet. The bot requires a string to already exist. An example is shown below:

	[Substitute Example]
	time: 0 0 * * *
	user: ExampleUser
	function: Substitute
	date: None # notice date will not be used by this bot
	message: Hello %s
	substitute_message: @examplefriend # this must be defined for this bot-type

This configuration will cause the bot to run at midnight everyday. The bot will always tweet "Hello @examplefriend"

####Standard####
This bot is designed to tweet a hardcoded message. The bot requires the string to be defined. An example is shown below:

	[Standard Example]
	time: 0 0 * * *
	user: ExampleUser
	function: Standard
	date: None # notice date will not be used by this bot
	message: This is a standard tweet.
	substitute_message: None # notice substitute_message will not be used by this bot
	
This configuration will cause the bot to run at midnight everyday. The bot will always tweet "This is a standard tweet."

Please ensure that for each bot configuration all of the fields shown in the template below are included.

####Template####
